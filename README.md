## WIP -> UAP : Universal Analytics Platform (AWS-based)


### 1.Universal Analytics Platform architecture with AWS EMR cluster, AWS Kinesis Firehose, Snowflake DWH, AWS DynamoDB, AWS RDS, AWS SageMaker, Matillion (Batch/ETL), etc.:

Note1: Near Real-Time Data/Analytics Platform

Note2: Snowflake helped us to leverage big data and streaming capabilities that were impossible with the legacy solution. For big data, we were processing web logs for example within Apache Spark deployed on top of the EMR cluster. Snowflake accesses Parquet files, and we donâ€™t need to load them into Snowflake. For the streaming use case, we leveraged DynamoDB streams and Kinesis Firehose, and all data is sent into an S3 bucket where Snowflake can consume it.

### 2.Universal Analytics Platform architecture with AWS Kinesis, AWS SNS/SQS, Redshift DWH, Apache Airflow (Batch/ETL), etc.:
